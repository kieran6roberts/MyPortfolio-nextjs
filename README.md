# My Personal Portfolio

An updated personal front-end developer portfolio site for myself highlighting my skills and personal projects. It includes case studies of my primary projects, a skills section and contact information through my social links and contact form. This updated version was created using next.js and its static generation capabilities to pull my project information from graphcms using graphql-request. TypeScript is also used in order for me begin learning the language by using it in a real project for its ability to reduce the chance of bugs and errors entering my code.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project was to create a performant and responsive site to show my work and skills to potential employers or clients using a simple and clean UI desing. The first part could be achieved through the static site generation offered by next.js which also ensures dry code by re-factoring similar elements into components. The styling would be handled using tailiwndcss to ensure time-efficient development without losing the ability to customize when required.
